## Motivation
cif2lammps is a Python 3 program used to convert crystals (developed initially for metal-organic frameworks) to Large-scale Atomic Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) format. 

## Current Status
cif2lammps can be used to convert ToBaCCo (https://github.com/tobacco-mofs/tobacco_3.0) generated cifs LAMMPS data and input according to the UFF/UFF4MOF. More force-fields and the option to use custom force-fields will be added. Keep in mind this is the very first version of the code, and I (Ryther) wrote is quite quickly, so expect to need adapt it yourself to use in the current state. 

## Requirements
Just download Anaconda. This should work for Py2 or Py3.
